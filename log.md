# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1 - Jan. 3, 2017 (1h39m)

*Today's project* - Finished the last intermediate algorithm challenge on FCC, got halfway through the Git backend challenge.

*Thoughts* - This week I'm focusing on getting through my last few challenges, so i'm at a point where I'm ready to go through some projects. I especially wanted to get partway through the Git challenge because I honestly didn't see the fork button at the top and had no clue how to get my own copy of this repo! lol There's still a LOT of working with Git I don't understand but I've made a small step and can at least get it online. Today's algorithm challenge took a good bit of my time, had to rewrite it a few times before I finally got it working. Feels good to be through the intermediate ones!

Day 2 - Jan. 4, 2017 (1h12m)

*Today's project* - Finished Git challenge, spent some time investigating google sheets API

*Thoughts* I want to create a simple inventory site for my current workplace. I've been attempting working on this project for months, and even got the main html set up like I wanted...but I've struggled big time to get the database/object storage side down. Hence me spending time working on the back end challenges to try and figure out how to make this project work. If I can use these 100 days to get that actually working, I'll be incredibly pleased. Today did not make any progress....more of my time was spent trying to set up my dev area for the site (clearing away past attempts). Right now I'm thinking I can somehow use the google sheets API (since I have my current data on my personal google drive) to then show, read, and write to those cells, and let my sheet be my database. Very unskilled in reading and utilizing API's that don't specifically show JS samples, though.
