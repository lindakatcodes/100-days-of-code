# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1 - Jan. 3, 2017 (1h39m)

*Today's project* - Finished the last intermediate algorithm challenge on FCC, got halfway through the Git backend challenge.

*Thoughts* - This week I'm focusing on getting through my last few challenges, so i'm at a point where I'm ready to go through some projects. I especially wanted to get partway through the Git challenge because I honestly didn't see the fork button at the top and had no clue how to get my own copy of this repo! lol There's still a LOT of working with Git I don't understand but I've made a small step and can at least get it online. Today's algorithm challenge took a good bit of my time, had to rewrite it a few times before I finally got it working. Feels good to be through the intermediate ones!
