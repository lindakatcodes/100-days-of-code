# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1 - Jan. 3, 2017 (1h39m)

*Today's Challenge* - Finished the last intermediate algorithm challenge on FCC, got halfway through the Git backend challenge.

*Thoughts* - This week I'm focusing on getting through my last few challenges, so i'm at a point where I'm ready to go through some projects. I especially wanted to get partway through the Git challenge because I honestly didn't see the fork button at the top and had no clue how to get my own copy of this repo! lol There's still a LOT of working with Git I don't understand but I've made a small step and can at least get it online. Today's algorithm challenge took a good bit of my time, had to rewrite it a few times before I finally got it working. Feels good to be through the intermediate ones!

Day 2 - Jan. 4, 2017 (1h12m)

*Today's Challenge* - Finished Git challenge, spent some time investigating google sheets API

*Thoughts* - I want to create a simple inventory site for my current workplace. I've been attempting working on this project for months, and even got the main html set up like I wanted...but I've struggled big time to get the database/object storage side down. Hence me spending time working on the back end challenges to try and figure out how to make this project work. If I can use these 100 days to get that actually working, I'll be incredibly pleased. Today did not make any progress....more of my time was spent trying to set up my dev area for the site (clearing away past attempts). Right now I'm thinking I can somehow use the google sheets API (since I have my current data on my personal google drive) to then show, read, and write to those cells, and let my sheet be my database. Very unskilled in reading and utilizing API's that don't specifically show JS samples, though.

Day 3 - Jan. 5, 2017 (1h53m)

*Today's Challenge* - Worked on getting my google spreadsheet to connect and show data on my solo site - FINALLY GOT IT TO WORK!

*Thoughts* - I can hardly believe that I FINALLY got my data to show! I've spent literally MONTHS trying to work out how to connect a database to this, and have attempted to use the Google Sheets API before without success. Somehow tonight I finally found the right examples and references to work out some code that's actually working. Over the moon excited! Tomorrow I'll focus on setting my code up to a GitHub repo so I can share it as I go with everyone. Next task will then be working out how to make changes to the data so they'll store in the spreadsheet.....

Day 4 - Jan. 6, 2017 (1h40m)

*Today's Challenge* - Figure out how to get my local machine set up so I can edit / create on there and push my code to GitHub

*Thoughts* - Well, there's still a ton I don't understand about git and GitHub and how it all connects with VS Code, my current editor of choice. My working solution atm is to open just the specific folder I'm working on (which I'm not crazy about - I like having my programming folder open so I can see and switch between all my folders / projects but then the Git tab on VS Code wants to create a repo for the whole folder and it doesn't work right), do whatever work I need to do, commit the changes there, then go to my GitHub on my local and sync the changes with my online version. Seems like too many steps, buuuuut for now, it's working and I reasonably get it. lol Also added what I still have left to do for full functionality on the project's readme so I can guide my work and check things off as I go!

Day 5 - Jan. 7, 2017 (2h42m)

*Today's Challenge* - Created my own start/home page! 

*Thoughts* - I've wanted to do this for awhile and even started a few weeks ago, but other things kept coming up. Today I finally sat down, changed a few things up, and got together a site that I actually really like. I'm hoping it'll make things faster for me when I'm working on other challenges!

Day 6 - Jan. 8, 2017 (~2h44m)

*Today's Challenge* - Completed the Express challenge on FCC & helped my partner show his live streaming video on a personal webpage

*Thoughts* I am still majorly confused about Express. Did not feel like I really understood much about what I was actually doing through the tutorial. I mean I got through it, but I have zero faith I could actually use it in a real application. Still a long ways to go with that. Also felt like it used a TON of outside 'middleware' / libraries. I mean I think that's part of how it is, but....just confusing. 

Getting the video on a webpage was not near as hard as it sounded when my partner asked me...we found an easy way to get the embed code from the media server he's using, and from there it was just a matter of getting it saved in the right folder and getting the hosting for the webpage set up. Did a little bit of styling to get the video horizontally centered and changed the background color. He's super pleased with it, so I'm really glad I could help him. :)
